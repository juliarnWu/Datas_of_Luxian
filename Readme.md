# Shale Gas Induced Seismicity Risk Prediction in Luxian County - Random Forest Model Testing

## Project Overview

This project uses a Random Forest model to predict the seismicity risk induced by shale gas development in Luxian County. The model is tested using the following essential datasets:

- Fault data at a depth of 4 km
- Hydraulic fracturing well distribution data
- Earthquake catalog data

These datasets are used to train and test the Random Forest model for predicting the risk of induced seismicity during shale gas extraction in Luxian.

## Datasets

1. **Fault Data**: Contains information on faults at a depth of 4 km underground.

2. **Fracture Well Distribution**: Contains the distribution of hydraulic fracturing wells in Luxian.

3. **Earthquake Catalog**: A record of historical seismic events in Luxian, including information such as event time, location, depth, and magnitude.
