# Shale Gas Induced Seismicity Risk Prediction in Luxian County - Random Forest Model Testing

## Project Overview

This project uses a Random Forest model to predict the seismicity risk induced by shale gas development in Luxian. The model is tested using the following essential datasets:

- Fault data (preprocessing)
- Hydraulic fracturing well data (preprocessing)
- Earthquake energy data (preprocessing)
- Seismicity data (preprocessing)
- VS30 data (preprocessing)

These datasets are used to train and test the Random Forest model for predicting the risk of induced seismicity during shale gas extraction in Luxian.

## Datasets

1. **Fault Data**

2. **Fracture Well**

3. **Earthquake energy**

4. **Seismicity**

5. **VS30 Data**
